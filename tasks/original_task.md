### üö® Troubleshooting Guide
If you have any questions or problems, follow this procedure: <br/>

1. Look at this week's [posted issues](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues). Are other students asking about your problem?
2. If not, post a question yourself by creating a [New Issue](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/inda-24/help/issues/new). Add a descriptive title, beginning with "Task *x*: *summary of problem here*"
3. Ask a TA in person during the [weekly lab](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/INDA). Check your schedule to see when the next lab is.

We encourage you to discuss with your course friends, **but do not share answers!** Similarily, use of any AI services ü§ñ are great to help explain things, **but please do not submit AI-generated solutions** - you must be both responsible for your own solutions and must be able to explain them under examination.

### üèõ Assignment
Most programming languages have several _data structures_ as a part of the language. These allow the programmer to store and operate on data in various ways, with different characteristics and strengths. In Java, the most simple data structure is the *array* (svensk √∂vers√§ttning: *samling*), as explained in [Oracle's Offical Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html).

<details>
  <summary> üìö A summary of Java's arrays </summary>

 The following code shows various ways to create arrays. Most programming languages are *0-indexed*, so in order to access the first element of an array, you have to start from zero:

```
array: | a | b | c | d |
index:   0   1   2   3
```

Arrays have a special syntax in Java:

```java
public class Arrays {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create an array called 'array'
    int[] array;

    // Allocate memory for 4 integers
    array = new int[4];

    // Assign values by accessing their index
    array[0] = 1; // This is the first element
    array[1] = 3; // This is the second element
    array[2] = 3; // and so forth
    array[3] = 7;
   }
}
```

To help remember this fact, think of the index as how many elements you skip over. That is, `a[0]` gives us the first element in `a` since we skip over 0 elements.
Java allows you to create arrays using curly brackets (`{}`) too:

```java
public class Arrays {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // Create an array and assign four values
    int[] array = {0, 1, 2, 3};
  }
}
```

The `for` loop is useful in combination with arrays:

```java
public class Arrays {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    // Create an array and assign five strings
    String[] array = {"Never", "Gonna", "Give", "You", "Up"};

    // Print each element
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
      System.out.println(array[i]);
    }
  }
}
```

Methods can take arrays as parameters, and have arrays as return types:

```java
public class Arrays {

  /**
   * A method to calculate the sum of an integer array
   */
  public double sum(int[] input){
    double sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < input.length; i++){
      sum += input[i];
    }
    return sum;
  }

  /**
   * Returns an array with three zeros, as an example of methods returning arrays.
   */
  public int[] zeroArray() {
    // Create an array with space for three elements.
    int[] zeroArray = new int[3];
    // Fill it with zeros
    zeroArray[0] = 0;
    zeroArray[1] = 0;
    zeroArray[2] = 0;
    // Return it
    return zeroArray;
  }
}
```
---
</details>

<details>
<summary> üìö The foreach loop </summary>

Java has a special loop called the `foreach` loop. It is also known as *the enhanced for loop*.
The `foreach` loop offers you a convenient way to iterate each member of
a collection, in order:

```java
for (TYPE name : COLLECTION) {
    // Do something with object 'name'
}
```
  
The loop reads as _"for each object *name* of type *TYPE* in *COLLECTION*..."_. 
Assuming that `myArray` is an array of `Double`, the above example can be rewritten as:

```java
for (Double element : myArray) { 
// Read as ``For each "element" of type "Double" in "myArray"...¬¥¬¥
    doSomething(element);
}
```

The `COLLECTION` may be an array, but could also be some other Java class that supports iteration,
such as `ArrayList`, which will be further explained as we progress in this task.
You can read more about the different types of for-statements in the official
[Oracle tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html).

</details>

<details>
  <summary> üìö The static keyword</summary>

You will notice that all method headers that you are asked to add to your
`Arrays.java` file has the `static` keyword between the access modifier
and the return type. You may also have seen this keyword in the header of the
main method and wondered what it means. `static` means that a field or
method is particular to the _class_ rather than any specific _object_
(remember that a _class_ can be used as a "template" to create many
different _objects_). For instance, if you created a `Clock` class,
and added the field `private static int hours`, this value would be
shared between every `Clock` object you create, so that they all are
set to the same hour.

A `static` method is a method that will behave the same for every
object of a class. This means that instead of creating an object we can
call the method directly in the class, so instead of writing
```java
Arrays arraysInstance = new Arrays();
int averageOfSomeArray = arraysInstance.average(someArray);
```
we can write
```java
int averageOfSomeArray = Arrays.average(someArray);
```
You may have already seen this way of calling a method when using methods
from the `Math` library. A `static` method can _only_ use fields and
call other methods that are also `static`, but makes your code simpler
and more efficient. Since all the methods we will be adding to the
`Arrays` class doesn't need to access any fields at all it makes sense
to keep them `static`.

You can read more about the `static` keyword in the
[Official Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html).

#### Exercise 5.0 -- The Arrays class
Begin by creating a new class where you will enter your solutions for the coming exercises. 
This class should be called `Arrays` and be in a file called `Arrays.java` in the [src](src) folder.

#### Exercise 5.1 -- Average of an array

Write a method that returns the average of an array with the following header:

```java
public static int average(int[] array)
```

> **Assistant's Note:** The average should be rounded down to the closest integer. Remember that integer division by default *rounds down*, so the average of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` is *2*. 

#### Exercise 5.2 -- Average of an array... again?
Write another method that returns the average of an array, this time with the header:

```java
public static double average(double[] array)
```

> **Assistant's note:** Once again we use [function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading). Since the parameters differ between the methods, it is fine for them to have the same name. In this case, the parameters differ in their type -- `int[]` vs. `double[]` -- so it is okay for them to share the same name.


#### Exercise 5.3 -- Smallest element of an array
Write a method that returns the smallest element of an array. It must have the following header:

```java
public static int smallestElement(int[] array)
```
If the array is empty it should return the highest integer value instead. To obtain the maximum integer value you can call `Integer.MAX_VALUE;`.

<details>
    <summary> üìö Why is there a maximum integer value? </summary>

To store integers in the computer memory we use a fixed number of bits so that we can keep track of how much computer memory needs to be allocated. Specifically, Java uses 32 bits to represent integer values of type `int`. Each bit can be either on or off (0 or 1) The maximum value that can be represented using 32 bits is 2^31 - 1, which equals 2,147,483,647.

The reason for this limit is due to the way integers are stored in binary format. In a 32-bit `signed integer`, the leftmost bit is used as the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative), and the remaining 31 bits are used to represent the magnitude of the number. The sign bit effectively reduces the range of positive values by one bit.

With 31 bits available for the magnitude, the maximum positive value that can be represented is when all 31 bits are set to 1, which corresponds to the decimal value 2^31 - 1.

If you attempt to assign a value larger than the maximum integer value to an int variable, it will result in an overflow, and the value will wrap around to the minimum integer value (2^31, or -2,147,483,648) and continue counting from there. This behavior is known as `integer overflow`.

  <details>
    <summary> Why -2,147,483,648? </summary>
In Java, the int data type uses 32 bits of memory. A "bit" is the most basic unit of information in computing and can be either a 0 or a 1. You can actually represent integers with their binary representation in java:

```java
// integer '0' in its binary representation
int a = 0b00000000000000000000000000000000; // thirty-two 0's!
// integer '1' in its binary representation
int b = 0b00000000000000000000000000000001; // note the one
// integer '2' in its binary representation
int c = 0b00000000000000000000000000000010; 
```

So, why does this matter? Well, the number of different combinations we can get with 32 bits determines the range of numbers an int can represent.

But there's a catch: one of these bits is used to represent whether the number is positive or negative. So, we're really left with 31 bits to store the actual number. Look at how `-1` is represented:

```java
// integer '-1' in its binary representation
// the leftmost 1, right after the 'b', signal this is a negative number
int a = 0b11111111111111111111111111111111;
```

Th binary representation of negative numbers have their own logic, called the [Two's Complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Using these 31 bits, the largest positive number we can represent is 2,147,483,647 (or 2^31 - 1), and that's why this is the maximum integer value in Java. After that, there just aren't enough different bit combinations left to represent any larger numbers. You are going to learn how this works as you progress you studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology!

> **Assistant's note:** By _smallest_, we mean the one closest to -‚àû. 

#### Exercise 5.4 -- Reverse
Write a method that takes an `int` array and returns a copy of this 
array with the elements in _reverse order_. It should have the following header:
```java
public static int[] reverse(int[] array)
```

Here is an example of how it should work:
```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3};
int[] reversed = reverse(array);
// The reversed array should be {3, 2, 1}
```
Make sure to not modify the original array. Your method should 
create a new array.

#### Exercise 5.5 -- Return all even numbers in an array
Create a method that returns all *even* numbers in an array. It should have the following header:

```java
public static int[] evenNumbers(int[] array)
```
This method should _not_ modify the original array that's provided as a parameter. It should simply create a new 
array containing all the even numbers (in the same order) from the original array.

> **Assistant's note:** One approach is to use two `for` loops - first, one to count the number of even numbers in order to create a new array with the right size, and then one loop to copy all even numbers. A number *n* is even if *n ‚â° 0 (mod 2)*. You should use the [remainder operator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op1.html) for this purpose.

### Set Theory

Arrays are very useful for storing a specific number of elements of the same type,
but what if you don't know ahead of time how many objects you need to store?
In order to handle this, the Java standard library includes the class
[`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html)
which is quite similar to an array, but lets you grow the number of
elements stored as needed.

 Your task at hand is now to model mathematical sets with `ArrayLists`. A set is defined as having *unique* elements. For example, *{1, 2, 2, 3}* is **not** a set, whereas *{1, 2, 3}* is a set. It is up to your implementations to guarantee this assumption. In this assignment, we refer to the *universe* by the following definition:

<img src="images/universe.png" alt="universe" width="200"/>


That is, the universe is the set of all integers from 0 to 99.

> **Assistant's note:** In programming, there are other data structures that should be used in place of `ArrayLists` when modeling sets, for example [HashSets](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html). But for the purpose of this exercise, you have to *suspend reality* and please do not use the obvious solution for this exercise.

  <summary> üìö Algebra of sets </summary>

  The Wikipedia article on [Algebra of sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets) can serve as a reminder of the fundamental properties of set algebra. This is also covered in SF1671, which you have in parallel to DD1337. To pass the assignment, make sure you test the following cases:

<img src="images/algebra-of-sets.png" alt="algebra of sets" width="150"/>


  The *cardinality* of a set is the number of elements it contains.

<details>
<summary> üìö A summary of Java's ArrayLists</summary>

In order to use an `ArrayList` you must first _include_ it in your class file.
You do this by adding the line
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```
at the top of the file. This tells the Java compiler to look for the
class called `ArrayList` in the `util` (utilities) package.

Creating an `ArrayList` looks slightly different from creating an array.
To create an `ArrayList` containing `Integer`s, the syntax is
```java
ArrayList<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>();
```
`ArrayList` is a class like any other, so we use the
`new ClassName();` syntax. However, you might be wondering what is going
on with the `<>` symbols. The `<Integer>` after
the class name tells Java that this `ArrayList` will contain `Integer`
objects, just like you could create an array of type `Integer[]`.
The word in `<>` could of course be the name of any class, but _not_
a generic type (such as `int`). If you try something like
```
ArrayList<int> intList = new ArrayList<>();
```
you will get a compile error (try it!). This concept of specifying that a class 
will contain or otherwise use a particular type of object is called `generic` types in Java.
You don't need to understand it fully right now, but you can read more about it in the
[Oracle Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/types.html).

You can add new elements to your `ArrayList` with the `add` method,
and change the value of an element with the `set` method:
```java
integerList.add(5);
integerList.set(0, 11); // First element will now be 11
```

You can get elements at a specific index with the `get` method:
```java
int firstValue = integerList.get(0);
```
note that `ArrayLists` are 0-indexed just like arrays.
You might remember that `integerList` contains `Integer`s, but
in this example, we store the return value as an `int`. In general,
Java can automatically convert between
[primitive types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)
and the corresponding [wrapper classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_wrapper_class_in_Java).

You can remove an object from your `ArrayList` using the `remove` method.
You can also remove _all_ the elements with the `clear` method.
```java
integerList.remove(0); // Will remove the first element
integerList.clear(); // Will remove everything that's left in the list
```

You can check how many elements are in an `ArrayList` using the `size` method.
This can be useful when you want to use a for-loop to iterate over your list.
```java
// Increase the value of every element by 1:
for (int i = 0; i < integerList.size(); i++) {
    int currentElement = integerList.get(i);
    currentElement += 1;
    integerList.set(i, currentElement);
}
```

<details>
  <summary> üìö Importing libraries and API </summary>

The Java SDK includes a vast amount of *libraries*, which are predefined classes you may use in your programs. Each library has an *Application Programming Interface* (API). The API is all the public methods in the class that you, as an outside programmer, can use to interact with the library. If you want to use an `ArrayList` in your program, you must first *import* the library:

  ```java
  import java.util.ArrayList; // Use the keyword 'import' to be able to use the ArrayList class
  
  public class Example {
    // Add some code using an ArrayList here
  }
  ```

The API of `ArrayList` consists of all the methods it contains that are available for you to use.
For example, `add()`, `get()`, and `isEmpty()`, are all a part of the ArrayList API. The rest of the API can be found in Oracle's [ArrayList documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html). The fastest way to find the documentation of any Java Class is to use Google Search: "<*library*> documentation", although they are all listed [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html).

---
</details>

#### Exercise 5.6 -- `SetTheory.java` and `generateSet`
Begin by creating a file called `SetTheory.java` in the [`src`](/src) folder. 
All remaining methods for this task should be placed in this file.

Create a method with the header
```java
public static ArrayList<Integer> generateSet(int min, int max)
```

This method should return an `ArrayList` with all elements between `[min, max)` (including min and excluding max). 
Remember that a *set* consists only of *unique* elements! If `min ‚â• max`, return an empty list. 
If `max > 100`, you should create a set containing all integers between `min` and 99.
Similarly, if `min < 0` return the set containing values between `0` and `max`.
We provide you with an example of a main method that could be added to `SetTheory.java`
and help you make sure that your code works as specified. Alternatively, you can
use [JShell](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm)
to run your code without a main method.

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example main method</summary>
  
```Java
// Example call
public static void main(String[] args){
  // call the "generateSet" method on the SetTheory object
  ArrayList<Integer> exampleSet = generateSet(10, 15);

  // if implemented correctly, "exampleSet" should be an ArrayList of the five integers between `[10, 14]`
  // [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
  System.out.println(exampleSet);
}
```
</details>


#### Exercise 5.7 -- union
Implement a method called `union` that finds the union of two sets. It must have the following header:

```java
  public static ArrayList<Integer> union(ArrayList<Integer> a, ArrayList<Integer> b)
```

It should return a new `ArrayList` containing the elements from the union of lists `a` and `b`. 
Use your implementation of `generateSet` to test your solution. 
Make sure that the returned `ArrayList` is a *set*, that is, it only contains *unique* elements.

> **Assistant's note:** Consider the edge case mentioned under "Algebra of sets". Make sure you understand and handle those cases correctly. You can check if an `ArrayList` contains an element by invoking the `contains` method. Other useful methods are explained in the [official documentation of the ArrayList class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html).

#### Exercise 5.8 -- intersection
Implement a method called `intersection` that finds the intersection of two lists. It should return a new `ArrayList` with the intersection of the input. It must have the following method header:

```java
public static ArrayList<Integer> intersection(ArrayList<Integer> a, ArrayList<Integer> b)
```

> **Assistant's note:** Consider the edge case mentioned under "Algebra of sets". Make sure you understand and handle those cases correctly.

#### Exercise 5.9 -- complement

Make a method called `complement`, that returns the complement of the input set, that is, it returns an `ArrayList` of all integers between `0` and `99` *not* included in the provided set. It must have the following header:
  
```java
public static ArrayList<Integer> complement(ArrayList<Integer> a)
```

#### Exercise 5.10 -- cardinality
Make a method called `cardinality`, that returns the *cardinality* of a set. It must have the following method header:

```java
public static int cardinality(ArrayList<Integer> a)
```

We provide you with an example of how the `main` method could look when testing your solution:

<details>
  <summary> üõ† Example main method </summary>

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
  // make a set
  ArrayList<Integer> a = generateSet(0, 5)

  // call the "cardinality" method of the "SetTheory" object and store the result in an integer
  int cardinality = cardinality(a);

  // should print "5" to the terminal
  System.out.println(cardinality)

}
```
</details>


#### Exercise 5.11 -- cardinality of union
Make another method called `cardinalityOfUnion`, which returns the *cardinality* of the union of two sets, *A* and *B*, that is, |*A* U *B*|. It must have the following method header:

```java
public static int cardinalityOfUnion(ArrayList<Integer> a, ArrayList<Integer> b)
```
